Install like you would with any other WordPress plugin

1. Upload the bbPress-NL.zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Glad you asked. It's provided graciously by anyone and everyone who contributes on the [bbPress translation project on GlotPress](http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/bbpress).
